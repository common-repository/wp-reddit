== Description ==

Honestly, the short description is pretty much it. See it running on my website at <a href="http://avinasharora.com/">http://avinasharora.com</a> if you want a "demo" of sorts. I'm very new at this wordpress development thing, but I'm doing my best!

== Installation ==

When installing the plugin, upload this zip file. That's pretty much it. I haven't put any options in, because there's no configurability of any kind just yet.

If you want to disable it, just de-activate the plug in.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the image, style, or anything? =

Check the plugin folder. I tried to make it as open and decipherable as possible. Even the PHP file is pretty easy to work with (I hope).
The image size restrictions are embedded in the css file, and the image itself is 32x32 pixels, but you can change it to whatever you like.
